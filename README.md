# Senior Design Project Fall 2024
## Autonomous Watering System - Base Station
This repository contains the code for the microcontroller used in the base station of the system. Not everything is uploaded as the repository would be way too big with the build files. I used the ESP-IDF setup within VSCode.

## Specifications
### Microcontrollers
Tested on an ESP-WROOM-32
Intended to be an ESP32-S3 on the final product

### Display
2.2in TFT LCD Display with ILI9488 Drivers. SPI interface

## Schematic Notes
This is on KiCAD 6.0. Footprints for the ESP32 can be found here: https://github.com/espressif/kicad-libraries/tree/legacy_kicad6?tab=readme-ov-file
